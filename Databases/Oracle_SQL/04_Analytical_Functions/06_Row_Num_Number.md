# ROWNUM

If you were to implement a Top-N or pagination query in an Oracle database, you wouldnâ€™t find any dedicated clause to limit the query result like TOP, LIMIT or FETCH FIRST. For each row returned by the query, Oracle provides a ROWNUM pseudocolumn that returns a number indicating the order in which the database selects the row from a table or set of joined views.

ROWNUM is a pseudocolumn that gets many people into trouble. A ROWNUM value is not permanently assigned to a row (this is a common misunderstanding). It may be confusing when a ROWNUM value is actually assigned. A ROWNUM value is assigned to a row after it passes filter predicates of the query but before query aggregation or sorting. What is more, a ROWNUM value is incremented only after it is assigned.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM
  (
  SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
  FROM
    EMPLOYEES
  ORDER BY salary DESC
  )
WHERE ROWNUM <= 2
```

# ROW_NUMBER

ROW_NUMBER assigns a unique number from 1-N to the rows within a partition.
At first glance this may seem similar to the RANK and DENSE_RANK analytic functions,
but the ROW_NUMBER function ignores ties and always gives a unique number to each row.

```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER ([ query_partition_clause ] order_by_clause)

-- EXAMPLE
select employee_id, first_name, salary,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (order by salary desc ) r_num
from
  EMPLOYEES;

```
