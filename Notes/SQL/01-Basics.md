```sql
-- SELECT Statement
-- this is where we specify what columns we want returned
SELECT *
FROM customers;

-- AS keyword
-- we can give columns better, descriptive names with an alias
SELECT points * 10 + 100 AS discount_factor

-- if you want to use spaces between the alias name, you must use single quotes
SELECT points * 10 + 100 AS 'discount factor'

-- return distinct values

-- we use the where clause to filter data

>   -- greater than
>=  -- greater than or equal to
<   -- less than
<=  -- less than or equal to

```sql

```sql
-- IN operator
-- We can use the IN operator when we want to compare to a list of values
SELECT *

WHERE state IN ('CA', 'FL', 'VA');

-- we can also combine this with the NOT operator
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE state NOT IN ('CA', 'FL', 'VA');

```sql
-- BETWEEN Operator
-- compare to a range of values
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 and 2000;

```sql
-- LIKE operator
-- get values that match a specicific string pattern
SELECT *
FROM customers
-- name starts with b
WHERE last_name LIKE 'b%'
-- name ends with b
WHERE last_name LIKE '%b'
-- name has 3 characters between y and b
WHERE last_name LIKE 'b___y'
-- name containes 'field' anywhere
WHERE last_name LIKE '%field%'

-- % means any number of characters
-- _ means a single character
-- not case sensitive
```

```sql
-- REGEXP
-- regular expressions
SELECT

-- ^ begins with

-- [abcd] contains any of the values inside the brackets
-- [a-f] contains any of the values in the range

-- to find the values that are null
-- all customers who don't have a phone number

```sql
-- ORDER BY
-- use to sort results
SELECT last_name, first_name, points * 10 AS discount

-- Order by last name, default is ascending order
ORDER BY last_name;
-- descending order
ORDER BY last_name DESC;
-- order by column not in SELECT statement
ORDER BY birth_date;
-- order by alias
ORDER BY discount;
-- order by multiple columns.

```sql
-- LIMIT
-- limit the number of records returned in a query
SELECT *

-- limits the first 300 records only
